            Built in less than a week, <a href="http://geekout.herokuapp.com">GeekOut</a> was my first project after only 3 weeks of developer training. It was built with Ruby on Rails, HTML & CSS, and utilizes a complex SQL database to associate and filter events with tags related to specific interests. Users can filter by single or multiple tags to find local events related to their passions.
