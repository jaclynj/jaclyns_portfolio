      I'm a quick learner and a tech lover with a diverse set of skills. I began teaching myself programming in mid-2013 and fell in love with it, so I made the decision to immerse myself in it and commit to a full-time intensive course at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive">General Assembly</a>. There, I spent more than 60 hours a week building projects and learning best practices in full-stack Rails & JavaScript development. I am very proud of how far I have come in the 3 month training and am excited to continue endlessly learning and building!<br><br>
      <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jaclynejimenez">Before deciding to become a developer</a>, I have gained over 3 years of professional experience executing interactive initiatives utilizing a diverse set of technical, writing, design, and problem solving skills as a project coordinator for websites and live events.<br><br>
      When I'm not coding, I am usually indulging in my obsession with video games, whether it be playing them, talking about them, or attending conferences or tournaments.
