      I'm a quick learner and a tech lover with a diverse skill set. I began teaching myself programming in mid-2013 and fell in love with it, so I made the decision to commit to a full-time immersive course at <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/web-development-immersive" target="_blank">General Assembly</a>. There, I spent more than 60 hours a week building projects and learning best practices in full-stack Rails & JavaScript development. I am very proud of how far I have come in the 3 month bootcamp and am excited to continue endlessly learning and building!<br><br>
      <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jaclynejimenez" target="_blank">Before deciding to become a developer</a>, I have gained over 3 years of professional experience executing online initiatives while utilizing a diverse set of technical, writing, design, and problem solving skills.
